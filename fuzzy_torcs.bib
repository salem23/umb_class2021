    abstract = {We propose a method for evolving neural network controllers robust with respect to variations of the environmental conditions (i.e. that can operate effectively in new conditions immediately, without the need to adapt to variations). The method specifies how the fitness of candidate solutions can be evaluated, how the environmental conditions should vary during the course of the evolutionary process, which algorithm can be used, and how the best solution can be identified. The obtained results show how the method proposed is effective and computational tractable. It allows to improve performance on an extended version of the double-pole balancing problem, outperform the best available human-designed controllers on a car racing problem, and generate effective solutions for a swarm robotic problem. The comparison of different algorithms indicates that the CMA-ES and xNES methods, that operate by optimizing a distribution of parameters, represent the best options for the evolution of robust neural network controllers.},

abstract="This work presents an evolutionary approach to optimize the parameters of a Fuzzy-based autonomous driver for the open simulated car racing game (TORCS). Using evolutionary algorithms, we intend to optimize a modular fuzzy agent designed to determine the optimal target speed as well as the steering angle during the race. The challenge in this kind of fuzzy systems is the design of the membership functions, which is usually done through a trial and error process, but in this paper an adapted real-coded Genetic Algorithm with two different fitness functions - has been applied to find the best values for these parameters, obtaining a robust design for the TORCS controller. The evolved drivers were tested and evaluated competing against other TORCS controllers in practice mode, without rivals, and real races. The optimized fuzzy-controllers yield a very good performance, mainly in tracks that have many turning points, which are, in turn, the most difficult for any autonomous agent. Thus, this is a real enhancement of the baseline fuzzy controllers which had several difficulties to drive in this kind of circuits.",
