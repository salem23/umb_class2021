abstract="We tell the story of BrilliAnt, the winner of the Ant Wars contest organized within GECCO'2007, Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference. The task for the Ant Wars contestants was to evolve a controller for a virtual ant that collects food in a square toroidal grid environment in the presence of a competing ant. BrilliAnt, submitted to the contest by our team, has been evolved through competitive one-population coevolution using genetic programming and a novel fitnessless selection method. In the paper, we detail the evolutionary setup that lead to BrilliAnt's emergence, assess its human-competitiveness, and describe selected behavioral patterns observed in its strategy.",
