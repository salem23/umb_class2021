abstract="We propose a new particle swarm optimization algorithm for problems where objective functions are subject to zero-mean, independent, and identically distributed stochastic noise. While particle swarm optimization has been successfully applied to solve many complex deterministic nonlinear optimization problems, straightforward applications of particle swarm optimization to noisy optimization problems are subject to failure because the noise in objective function values can lead the algorithm to incorrectly identify positions as the global/personal best positions. Instead of having the entire swarm follow a global best position based on the sample average of objective function values, the proposed new algorithm works with a set of statistically global best positions that include one or more positions with objective function values that are statistically equivalent, which is achieved using a combination of statistical subset selection and clustering analysis. The new PSO algorithm can be seamlessly integrated with adaptive resampling procedures to enhance the capability of PSO to cope with noisy objective functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new algorithm is able to consistently find better solutions than the canonical particle swarm optimization algorithm in the presence of stochastic noise in objective function values with different resampling procedures.",

    abstract = { Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is a new evolutionary optimization algorithm that is based on the science of biogeography. In this paper, BBO is applied to the optimization of problems in which the fitness function is corrupted by random noise. Noise interferes with the BBO immigration rate and emigration rate, and adversely affects optimization performance. We analyse the effect of noise on BBO using a Markov model. We also incorporate re-sampling in BBO, which samples the fitness of each candidate solution several times and calculates the average to alleviate the effects of noise. BBO performance on noisy benchmark functions is compared with particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), self-adaptive DE (SaDE) and PSO with constriction (CPSO). The results show that SaDE performs best and BBO performs second best. In addition, BBO with re-sampling is compared with Kalman filter-based BBO (KBBO). The results show that BBO with re-sampling achieves almost the same performance as KBBO but consumes less computational time. }

abstract="When combined with machine learning, the black-box analysis of fitness landscapes promises to provide us with easy-to-compute features that can be used to select and configure an algorithm that is well-suited to the task at hand. As applications that involve computationally expensive, stochastic simulations become increasingly relevant in practice, however, there is a need for landscape features that are both (A) possible to estimate with a very limited budget of fitness evaluations, and (B) accurate in the presence of small to moderate amounts of noise. We show via a small set of relatively inexpensive landscape features based on hill-climbing methods that these two goals are in tension with each other: cheap features are sometimes extremely sensitive to even very small amounts of noise. We propose that features whose values are calculated using population-based search methods may provide a path forward in developing landscape analysis tools that are both inexpensive and robust to noise.",

abstract="Genetic algorithms are adaptive search techniques which have been used to learn high-performance knowledge structures in reactive environments that provide information in the form of payoff. In general, payoff can be viewed as a noisy function of the structure being evaluated, and the learning task can be viewed as an optimization problem in a noisy environment. Previous studies have shown that genetic algorithms can perform effectively in the presence of noise. This work explores in detail the tradeoffs between the amount of effort spent on evaluating each structure and the number of structures evaluated during a given iteration of the genetic algorithm. Theoretical analysis shows that, in some cases, more efficient search results from less accurate evaluations. Further evidence is provided by a case study in which genetic algorithms are used to obtain good registrations of digital images.",
